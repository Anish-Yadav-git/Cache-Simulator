# Examples Directory

This directory contains example files and outputs for the cache simulator.

## üìÅ Structure

### `traces/`
Contains sample trace files for testing different cache behaviors:

- **`sample_trace.txt`** - Basic example with various memory access patterns
- **`program_trace.txt`** - Complex trace simulating real program execution

### `output/`
Directory for output files generated by the cache simulator:
- Statistics files (`.txt`)
- Log files (`.log`) 
- CSV reports (`.csv`)

*Note: Output files are git-ignored to keep the repository clean.*

### `scripts/`
Contains demonstration and utility scripts:
- **`replacement_policy_demo.sh`** - Interactive demonstration of different cache replacement policies

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Process Sample Trace
```bash
# Basic processing with default cache configuration
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/sample_trace.txt

# Save output to examples/output directory
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/sample_trace.txt -o examples/output/sample_results.txt
```

### Compare Different Configurations
```bash
# LRU policy
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -r LRU -o examples/output/lru_results.txt -q

# FIFO policy
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -r FIFO -o examples/output/fifo_results.txt -q

# Random policy
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -r RANDOM -o examples/output/random_results.txt -q
```

### Different Cache Sizes
```bash
# Small cache (512 bytes)
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -s 512 -o examples/output/small_cache.txt -q

# Medium cache (2KB)
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -s 2048 -o examples/output/medium_cache.txt -q

# Large cache (8KB)
./bin/cache_simulator -t examples/traces/program_trace.txt -s 8192 -o examples/output/large_cache.txt -q
```

### Run Replacement Policy Demo
```bash
# Run the interactive demonstration script
./examples/scripts/replacement_policy_demo.sh

# This script will:
# 1. Build the cache simulator if needed
# 2. Run the same trace with LRU, FIFO, and RANDOM policies
# 3. Display cache contents and statistics for each policy
# 4. Save results to examples/output/ directory
```

## üìä Creating Custom Traces

### Trace File Format
```
# Comments start with #
# Format: <operation> <address>

# Sequential access pattern
R 0x1000
R 0x1004
R 0x1008
R 0x100C

# Write operations
W 0x2000
W 0x2004

# Mixed pattern
READ 0x3000
WRITE 0x3004
```

### Tips for Effective Traces
1. **Include comments** to document different phases
2. **Mix read and write operations** for realistic simulation
3. **Test different access patterns**:
   - Sequential (good spatial locality)
   - Strided (moderate locality)
   - Random (poor locality)
   - Repeated (good temporal locality)

## üéØ Analysis Workflows

### Performance Comparison
1. Create trace file representing your workload
2. Run with different cache configurations
3. Compare hit rates and performance metrics
4. Analyze results to find optimal configuration

### Educational Use
1. Start with simple sequential traces
2. Progress to more complex patterns
3. Demonstrate impact of cache parameters
4. Show real-world application traces
