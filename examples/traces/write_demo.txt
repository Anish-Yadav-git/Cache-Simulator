# Write operations demonstration trace
# This trace shows how write operations affect dirty bits in different scenarios

# Initial read operations to load some data
R 0x1000
R 0x1040
R 0x1080
R 0x10C0

# Write operations that will show dirty bit behavior
W 0x1000  # Write to already cached block
W 0x1020  # Write to new address (may cause miss)
W 0x1040  # Write to another cached block
W 0x1200  # Write to completely new address

# More reads to show cache state
R 0x1000  # Should hit and show dirty bit
R 0x1020  # Should hit if write-allocate
R 0x1040  # Should hit and show dirty bit

# Write to cause potential eviction
W 0x1300
W 0x1340
